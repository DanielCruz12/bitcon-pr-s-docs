              <p>
                I began programming at age 9 in BASIC and assembly
                language. From age 14 to 18, I wrote several professional
                games in assembly for Atari and Commodore computers that were
                internationally published and widely known.
              </p>
              <p>
                I studied Computer Science at
                <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd
                  College</a> in Claremont, California (USA), Business

                  State University</a>, followed by an MBA

                  target="_blank">INSEAD</a> in Fontainebleau, France. In
                  addition to software engineering, I have 2 years of marketing
                  brand management experience in mass consumer products at
                  L'Oréal from their world headquarters in Paris. I speak
                  English, French, German, and some Russian.

                Over the past decade I have been a freelance software engineer

                In March 2019, I started learning to contribute to Bitcoin Core,
                beginning with studying the repository and the social process
                and technical details of contributing to the project. I've been
                compiling and curating this knowledge at

              <p>
                It became clear that what is most needed and useful, and
                paradoxically the least done by new contributors, is
                <a href="/articles/on-reviewing-and-helping-those-who-do-it"
                   target="_blank">review and testing of PRs and issues</a>.
                More than

                target="_blank">350 pull requests</a>

                Bitcoin Core waiting for experienced review and testing, and the
                amount continues to increase. The maintainers need help!
              </p>
              <p>
                I quickly became an active reviewer and contributor to:
                <ul>

                In early June 2019, thanks to John Newbery and Adam Jonas, I was
                invited to attend the
                <a href="https://chaincode.com/" target="_blank">Chaincode
                Labs</a> summer residency Bitcoin seminars. I spent 2 weeks in
                the Chaincode Labs office in Manhattan learning about Bitcoin
                and meeting developers and the summer residents — an amazing
                experience.

            <section>
              <div class="title" id="future-work-in-more-detail">Future work in detail</div>
              <p>
                I prioritise my time to Bitcoin roughly as follows:
              </p>
              <h3 id="priorities">Robustness > Privacy > Features > Scaling > UI</h3>
              <p>
                Robustness and privacy/censorship resistance are therefore my
                highest priorities. I do also enjoy working on features or
                improving them.
              </p>
              <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Dedicating time to <b>review</b> of the important, critical PRs
                  that often sit for months without enough review to be merged
                  and have to go through multiple painful rebases, which blocks
                  vital progress and demotivates experienced long-term
                  contributors from working on Bitcoin Core.
                  <p>
                    The number one bottleneck in Bitcoin Core is experienced
                    review of difficult PRs. As
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/moneyball" target="_blank">Steve Lee</a>
                    of
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/sqcrypto" target="_blank">Square Crypto</a>
                    once wrote to me: "If literally all a developer did was
                    review hard but important PRs it'd be incredibly valuable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea is to unblock these critical PRs not only by
                    reviewing them, but also coordinating with the maintainers
                    and other contributors to ensure timely review where it is
                    most needed and difficult.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increasing Bitcoin Core's <b>robustness</b>: finding and
                  fixing regressions and bugs, improving the code, and adding
                  missing test coverage or improving it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strengthening Bitcoin Core's <b>decentralization</b>,
                  <b>censorship resistance</b> and <b>privacy</b> by working on
                  the peer-to-peer network privacy and resistance to
                  surveillance and attacks: researching and proposing
                  improvements, and collaborating with and testing work by
                  fellow developers and researchers.
                </li>
                <li>
