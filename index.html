                Navigating by the stars under cloudy skies â€” decentralize.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm concerned about human freedom, decentralization of power,
                individual empowerment, privacy and self-sovereignty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bitcoin and open source software play a key part in striving for
                these causes around the world that are increasingly important
                every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bitcoin isn't perfect.  Among other things, it needs further
                decentralization, continued vigilance, review, bug-fixing,
                updates and maintenance, and improved robustness, performance,
                privacy, documentation and user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a contributor to Bitcoin Core since early 2019, I pursue a
                quiet, long-term evergreen role of help and service, ideally
                with a measure of kindness, wisdom and forebearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                My time is invested in reviewing and context-packing the changes
                to the project, observing the process closely, reading every
                conversation, and looking at or reviewing most of the opened and
                merged pull requests.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea is two-fold: to potentially catch bugs or breaking
                changes merged into Bitcoin Core, and be prepared to help
                maintain the project, if needed.  I sometimes propose
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"
                   target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changes</a>
                to the code as well.
